	<h2>How it Works</h2>
	<p>FitKnit knits together your fitbit statistics and motivational psychology, primarily:
		<li><em>Self-monitoring</em>: viewing how many steps you're taking in an average day</li>
		<img src="http://placekitten.com/g/200/100" alt="picture of app with member signed in"/>
		<li><em>Cognitive restructuring</em>: self-talk in the style of: "I can do this!" instead of "wow, I'm sick of exercising, and I feel like a big blob and all my steps are between the couch and the bathroom."</li>

		<li><em>Modeling</em>: learning by watching another person perform the healthy behaviors you aspire to</li>
		<li><em>Goal-setting</em> - developing concrete, specific steps to take toward a goal</li></p>
