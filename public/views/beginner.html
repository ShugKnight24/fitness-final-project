<h1>5 x 5</h1>
<p>A great starter routine for those new to fitness is a 5 x 5 routine. It will allow you to get accustomed to most exercises while allowing you to make fairly linear progress. This program will allow you to build a solid foundation to build upon in the future.</p>
<p>The way you would approach this routine is to find weights that you feel comfortable completing 5 repititions for 5 sets. This may mean starting a bit lighter than you normally would. This will help to ensure that you complete all of your sets. Each following workout, you would add 5 pounds to each of the 5x5 exercises. If you feel comfortable increasing by more, go ahead, but. For accessory exercises, increase weight as you feel comfortable.</p>
<p>Warming up with the bar on all the exercises and slowly build up to your working sets. Warm ups do not count in the amount of sets you have done.</p>
<p>If you are unable to complete the 5x5, that is okay, complete it for as many reps and sets as you can. Try that weight again the next time you would perform that exercise. If you succeed in hitting 5x5, move up in weight the following workout. If you fail to hit 5x5 again, the next workout, you would reduce the weight you used by 10% and start building back up from there. If the number you get ends with a decimal, round down. Finally, only reduce the weight in the exercise you failed in.</p>
